# UCLAFerroboticsGUI
We have worked on the graphical user interface for UCLA i2BL's Ferrobotic project. Wedeveloped the graphical user interface from scratch using Python: the GUI simulates the physical PCB circuit board in which the magnetic chip on the board travels in a specific path to induce the drug suspended in magnetic fluid to travel down a specific path.  The purpose of the GUI is to control the path which the magnet moves electronically using coding. The speed and direction of the magnet is controlled by the GUI.
